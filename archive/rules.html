            <p>Buy pets and take care of them by clicking on them! Choose to
                feed, water, or play with your pet with each click. By taking
                care of your pet, you will also gain coins.
            </p>
            <p>Over time and with clicks, your pet will gain experience. With 
                enough experience, it will level up, increasing the amount of 
                coins per click.
            </p>
            <p>With enough coins, you can evolve your pet, giving them a new
                appearance and three levels!
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, you can buy items that will make it easier to
                take care of your pet.
