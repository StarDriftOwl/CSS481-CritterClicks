        <h1>CREDITS</h1>
        <p>Developed by team Cat Loafers for CSS 481, Web Development</p>
        <p>Team members:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Star</li>
            <p>Star is a student majoring in computer science and minoring in math at the University of Washington, Bothell. She is a self-taught 2D/3D artist aspiring 
                to become a technical artist in the game industry. She has experience with data structures & algorithms, database systems, and high-performance computing
                (working with CUDA). She knows Python, Java, Swift, C++, and C# but prefers to code in C++. She is a C++, NVIDIA graphic card, and Unreal Engine 
                superfan and swears by it.
                Born a Seattle native, Star enjoys drawing and playing video games (particularly Fortnite with builds), walking or running out in nature, and picking up random 
                hobbies like reading about exoplanets. She scored top 5% of having most allergies (including latex, pineapple, pollen, dust, dander, etc) although she started 
                getting allergy shots 2 years ago (and her symptoms have greatly subsided)! :]. Once self-proclaimed, “Sometimes, I live under a rock but I also enjoy the 
                finer things in life.”</p>
