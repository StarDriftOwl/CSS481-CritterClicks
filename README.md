## Build instructions
This project doesn't include dependencies and devDependencies (since that would take up a lot of storage), so run the following commands: \
`npm install` - installs required dependencies \
`npm run dev` - run project locally \
`npm run build` - compile project

## Help!! My local build isn't working
1. VSCode > Settings
2. Look up `files exclude`
3. Delete `node_modules` since VSCode ignores files that are listed in `.gitignore` \
(Refer to screenshot)
4. (Optional) You may need to re-run commands from [build-instructions](#build-instructions).
